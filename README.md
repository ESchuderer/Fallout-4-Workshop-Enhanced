You can do so directly from the Mod Organizer by right clicking the mods you like.

# Starting a new Game

To start the game you need to use the Mod Organizer as follows:
* Open the Wabbajack installation directory
* Open the "Mod Organizer"
* Ensure "Start F4WE" is selected in the dropdown on the top right (left of the run button)
* Hit that run button

## MCM Preset
I recommend to load the F4WE configuration preset once you left the Cryopod in Vault 111 by following these steps:
* Press ESC and open the `Mod Configuration Menu`
* Select the `-= MCM Settings Manager =-`
* Click apply besides the `F4WE Preset`
* ENJOY the game :)
