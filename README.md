# Pre Installation

Please ensure you're on a fresh and clean Fallout 4 installation without any mods or other changes.
If you want to restore a clean setup follow these steps:

* Uninstall Fallout 4 through Steam
* Open your Fallout 4 directory `*\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4`
* Delete all files in this folder
* Install Fallout 4 trough Steam
* Open the Game once
* Ensure to download all Creation Club content youd like to use, see [Supported Creation Club Content](#supported-creation-club-content)

# Installation

* Download and install [Wabbjack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/)
* Download and execute [Fallout 4 Workshop Extended.wabbajack](output/Fallout%204%20Workshop%20Extended.wabbajack)

### Known Issues

* FallOpt doesn't download
  * Download FallOpt manually and put it in the Wabbajack downloads folder: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/55662

# Post Installation

### Game Folder Files
* Open the `Game Folder Files` directory in your Wabbajack installation directory
* Copy the contents of the `Game Folder Files` directory
* Open your Fallout 4 game directory, eg. for Steam `Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout4`
* Paste the contents of the `Game Folder Files` directory

### Endorse Mods
Ensure to endorse the great work of the mod authors!
You can do so directly from the Mod Organizer by right clicking the mods you like.

# Starting a new Game

To start the game you need to use the Mod Organizer as follows:
* Open the Wabbajack installation directory
* Open the "Mod Organizer"
* Ensure "Start F4WE" is selected in the dropdown on the top right (left of the run button)
* Hit that run button

### MCM Preset
I recommend to load the F4WE configuration preset once you left the Cryopod in Vault 111 by following these steps:
* Press ESC and open the `Mod Configuration Menu`
* Select the `-= MCM Settings Manager =-`
* Click apply besides the `F4WE Preset`
* ENJOY the game :)
